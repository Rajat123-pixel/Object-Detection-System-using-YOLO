## Real Time Object Detection System using YOLO algorithm

This project implements a Real-Time Object Detection System using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm. YOLO is known for its speed and accuracy, making it an ideal choice for real-time applications where detection needs to occur in live video streams or images.

The system is designed to detect and classify objects in various scenarios, such as traffic monitoring, security surveillance, and autonomous vehicles. By leveraging the efficiency of YOLO, the system can process high-resolution images at impressive speeds without compromising detection accuracy.

### Key Highlights:
High-Speed Processing: Capable of detecting objects in real-time on live video feeds.
Versatility: Can be adapted for various applications, including safety, automation, and analytics.
Customizable: Supports training on custom datasets for specific use cases.
Scalability: Efficiently handles multiple object classes with different levels of complexity.
This project serves as a foundation for anyone looking to explore object detection in real-time scenarios, providing both pre-trained models and the tools to train your own models on custom data.
